# Milk-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project is based on the machine learning . In this project we focused onto making software for predicting the quality of milk.
In this project firstly we worked on the already given dataset Milk Quality prediction from kaggle and having a different milk related attribute then perform apply models from that XGboots give more accuracy which is used in this project to find Quality of milk.
